        <h2>NPM</h2>
        <p>You can use NPM as a 'shopping' for code packages.</p>
        <p>You do it through the terminal. To install a jquery and a normalize.css package you need to insert the following
            commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the folder you want to work on and command
                <strong>npm init</strong> to start npm. This will create a
                <strong class="colorBlue">package.json file</strong> in the directory. In this file you can see all the dependencies. Its our 'grocery'
                list where we keep track of all the extensions what we install through npm in our project.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>npm install jquery</strong> or replace jquery by any other package of choice. The installation will create
                the 'node-modules' folder and inside it the 'jquery' one. This will only install the package, but to make
                the installations organized and easy to be tracked, do it as follows:</li>
            <li>
                <strong>install jquery --save</strong>-- save will save the information that you installed jquery in your repo adding
                this information to the
                <strong class="colorBlue"> package.json</strong> file, under 'dependencies' (not the package-lock.json one). There you will also see
                the version of the package(s) which was installed. This file will save all the information on all the packages
                which were installed in a repo. After each installation, always add --save to keep this file up to date.
            </li>
            <li>Also, in case the packages have been deleted, you can also install everything again if you only have the package.json
                file. For that, inside the repo type
                <strong>npm install</strong>. That will install all directories with the packages files again, which were lost.</li>
            <li>After installing all the needed packages, rememeber to push them to the server. Just make sure to add the package.json
                file to the repo, add it to the staging area, commit it and push it to my github account.</li>
            <li>if you want to check the version of the package which you have installed, just type
                <strong>npm jquery -v</strong>. Or replace 'jquery' by the desired package</li>
            <li>In order to know which package to install look in npm website or google the action a package should perform followed
                by 'npm'</li>
            <li>Together with jquery, when starting a project, install also the normalize package (equivalent to reset in css): <strong>npm install normalize.css --save</strong></li>

        <h2>Gulp</h2>
        <p>Gulp is an extension which helps saving a lot of time with coding :)</p>
        <p>To work with Gulp you first want to make a global npm install:</p>
        <p>~ npm install gulp-cli --global</p>
        <p>This saved it on a more global. Now lets see all the steps to get it gulping! :D</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate through the command line to the proper directory</li>
            <li>
                <strong>npm install gulp --save-dev</strong> to install gulp in our working directory. This will create a 'package-lock.json'
                file which contains a 'dependencies' section and the 'devDependencies' section.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>gulp</strong> in the terminal to see the 'No gulpfile found' error. This is a proof that gulp was installed
                (otherwise gulp command would not work here)</li>
            <li>
                <strong>touch 'gulpfile.js' </strong> Create a javascript file called 'gulpfile.js'</li>
            <li>Fill in the file with content. Inserted
                <em class="colorBlue">var gulp = require('gulp');</em> in my script. If i insert 'gulp' in the terminal again, I should see the
                error 'Task default is not in your gulpfile'
            </li>
            <li>Fill in the gulpfile.js file adding the 'default' argument and a function which will run whatever you program
                it to:
                <br>gulp.task('default', function(){
                <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("you just created a gulp task")
                <br> })
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>gulp-watch</strong>: our first gulp automation plugin.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>npm install gulp-watch --save-dev</strong>
                <br> The
                <span class="colorBlue">--save-dev</span> is used to save all the changes done to the repo</li>
            <li>Add a gulp.task function to the
                <strong>gulpfile.js</strong> file:
                <br>
                <img src="gulp-watch.png" alt="gulp-watch" class="screenshots">
                <br>
                <div class="errorCorner">
                    <strong>Error Corner:</strong>
                    <br>
                    <!--IF future errors are documented, add a div here and create a style for the error corner :) -->
                    When trying to install gulp-watch I had the following error:
                    <br>
                    <strong>npm ERR! Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing near '...^2.0.1","is-binary-pa'</strong>
                    <br> I had a similar error once, and opened the error log file and saw a 304, then a 404 error - Bad DB internet!!
                    <br> So, this was probably stored in the cache. So I cleaned the cache by using the command
                    <strong>npm cache clear --force</strong>. Next time I can try npm cache clear (without force).
                    <br> Next, I ran the npm install gulp-watch --save-dev and it worked!!!! :D
                    <br> Read more on the error
                    <a href="https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/issues/990" target="_blank">here</a> or

                </div>
            </li>
            <li>To start using the watch task, we can just go to the command line and type
                <strong> gulp watch</strong>. When we do that, the watch function which is inside the 'gulp task' inside the gulpfile.js
                will be executed.
                <br>In the case of this example, we have the following code inside the gulp task:
                <img src="gulp-watch-close.png" alt="close">
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>Watch will keep running unless I stop it. To stop the watching, command
                <strong> ctrl + c</strong>
            </li>
            <li>I can also creat another watch task, like a 'css' task so that gulp is watching changes done to css files. Here
                is an example:
                <br>
                <img src="gulp-watch-css.png" alt="watch-css">
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>PostCSS and CSS Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>PostCSS</strong> We can create a 'temp' or whichever folder to store the changes which we want to occurr
                in the new css file which we want to work with. In order to create a new css file which will be our source
                (directly bound with the index.html data, we can create the 'temp' directory.</li>
            <li>Then, in the
                <strong class="colorBlue">gulpfile.js</strong> file, create the gulp.task which will then channel the change from the source file (original
                stylesheet) into the destination file (temporary filesheet).
                <br> This is how the code looks like in the travel-site example:
                <img src="channel-post-css.png" alt="channel-post-css">
            </li>
            <li>In order not to keep the one stylesheet too messed up, its a good practice to create other stylesheets. For instance,
                in the 'travel-site' project, we insert an additional directory(modules) and inside of it another stylesheet.
                <br> We will name the new stylesheet '_blabla.css'. The use of
                <strong class="colorBlue">_</strong> normally signalizes to other developpers that this should be a transitional stylesheet. This is
                a 'partial' file which wont be used in itself, but imported into another file.
                <br> In order to do this we use the keyword
                <strong class="colorBlue">@import</strong>. The @import is a native css code which we do not want the browser to directly load it.
                Rather we want the code to go to the partial file and use the css which is there.
                <br> This is an example of how this can be done in the main css file:
                <br>
                <img src="import-css-example.png" alt="">
                <br>Note that @import has to be placed right at the beginning of the css file.</li>
            <li>To make magic happens we will install postcss!</li>
            <li>First install gulp-postcss
                <strong>npm install gulp-postcss --save-dev</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Then install the import functionality with
                <strong>npm install postcss-import --save-dev</strong>
            </li>
            <li>In the gulpfile.js add the following code (note that the cssImport should come first on the array):
                <br>
                <img src="import-css-gulpfile.png" alt="import-css-gulpfile">
            </li>
            <li>in order to normalize or to reset the css, I can use the
                <strong>@import: "normalize.css" in the styles.css file:</strong>
                <br>
                <img src="normalize-css.png" alt="">
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
